# Machine Learning Projects - Regression

This repository contains various machine learning projects focused on different types of regression algorithms. The projects include simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, nonlinear regression, and polynomial regression. Each project is organized in separate files and directories.

## Projects Overview

1. **Simple Regression**  
   This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict a target variable based on a single feature.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   This project demonstrates linear regression using multiple features to predict an output variable.

3. **Nonlinear Regression**  
   In this project, nonlinear regression models are used to make predictions.

4. **Polynomial Regression**  
   This project uses polynomial regression to model more complex relationships between data points.# machine_learning
