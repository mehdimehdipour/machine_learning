# Machine Learning - Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a **Simple Linear Regression** model implemented to predict fuel consumption of vehicles using data. The model is built using the `FuelConsumption.csv` dataset and explores the relationship between different features (e.g., vehicle weight, engine size) and fuel consumption.

## Models:
1. **Simple Linear Regression**:
   - This model is used to predict a dependent variable based on a single independent variable.
   - It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to implement a Simple Linear Regression model to predict fuel consumption based on various vehicle features such as weight, engine size, etc.

## Dataset:
- **FuelConsumption.csv**: This dataset contains information about fuel consumption for different vehicles. It is used to train the regression model.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the `machine-learning-simple-linear-regression.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell to see the regression model training and results.

## File Structure:
- **machine-learning-simple-linear-regression.ipynb**: The notebook implementing the Simple Linear Regression model.
- **FuelConsumption.csv**: The dataset containing fuel consumption data for different vehicles.
- **.gitignore**: Files that should be ignored by Git.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib** (for data processing and visualization)

## Installation Instructions:
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
